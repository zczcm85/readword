# Custom command to install FFmpeg if needed.
# Streamlit Community Cloud usually has ffmpeg pre-installed,
# but if not, you might need a different approach or a custom Dockerfile.
# However, it's generally available.
# If it throws an error during deployment, you might need to add a packages.txt
# file in the root of your repo with 'ffmpeg' as a line.
